 WGF_focus_our_situation_desc: "The previously calm Goiky has now plunged into chaos, and our position in this madness is unenviable. The banner of socialism now bears only a small fragment in the north-west of Goiky, surrounded everywhere by traitors and counter-revolution. The obvious fact is the inevitable spread of the dictatorship of the proletariat throughout the continent, but for now the revolution must go on the defensive and take a good look at its situation and surroundings."

In the east, traitors and counter-revolutionaries have formed a military district and are planning a military campaign against North-Goikyland; in the south, the rotten regime is strangling our communications and external relations.

 WGF_focus_development_of_theory_desc: "Without good theory there can be no practice.

 WGF_focus_investigation: "Investigation"

 WGF_focus_socialist_army: "Red army"
 WGF_focus_socialist_army_desc: "A state without an army is like an object without hands; it is absolutely unable to stand up for itself. Moreover, a socialist state needs an army more than ever.

 GGR_focus_snowy_identity: "Snowy Identity"
 GGR_focus_snowy_identity_desc: "It is undeniable that the objects of the Snowy Plateau are distinguished by a special unity and cultural ties, which no other region of Goiky can boast of. We must maintain the unity of our nation at all costs and spread it."
 
 GGR_focus_einheitstadt: "§REinheitstadt§!"
 GGR_focus_einheitstadt_desc: "The snowy plateau is in a sad state: Low population density and backward industry hit the unity of the snowy objects very hard, and this is compounded by the southern national traitors and forest anarchists who appeared due to distrust of our government. A number of 'policies' will be undertaken to unite the people of the Snowy Plains."
 
 GGR_focus_fight_against_anarchy: "Fight against Anarchy"
 GGR_focus_fight_against_anarchy_desc: "Although on paper maps the Snowy Forest is part of our territory, in reality 'illegal authorities' have been operating there for a long time.

 GGR_focus_propaganda: "Propaganda"
 GGR_focus_propaganda_desc: "Trust in our national government is at a fairly low level. The objects of the Snowy Plateau, although distinguished by their cultural community, are quite passive in terms of political movements.

To achieve this result, we need grassroots political activity of the masses, which is why propaganda is one of our first moves."
 
 GGR_focus_our_way: "Third Way"

 GGR_focus_wrong_objects: "'Wrong' Objects"
 GGR_focus_wrong_objects_desc: "The essence of the elite of Goiky society has been known for a long time. Objects without upper limbs, small and weak, not only live at the expense of the workers, but also form secret fifth columns, with the help of which they control the objects under their control, pretending to be 'weak and innocent'. All of Old Goiky was imbued with this disgusting spirit, and it hit the Snowy Plateau hard.

 GGR_focus_emphasize_our_superiority_desc: "Snow Plateau is the most sublime and noble territory of Goiky in cultural and national terms, and this is an indisputable fact. Never in Goiky's history has any region been as tightly knit as the Snowy Plains and its people."

 YFC_focus_the_bunchivist_problem_desc: "With the defeat of Eraser and his cronies, we have found ourselves in a predicament. The bandit nation was quite a bit more... united than we had anticipated. Many of our new denizens, regardless of where in former bunchivist territory they live, have stated that they deserve to keep their national integrity. We are more than okay with demoloishing Bunchivism entirely. It is a beastly ideology, however, the way we go about it could most certainly determine our future standings. Just imagine the profits we could leech out of a Bunchivist puppet! Imagine how much recognition we'd get for eliminating all raider peoples! Forever."

 YFC_focus_the_economic_issue: "The Economic Issue"
 YFC_focus_the_economic_issue_desc: "Stocks have dropped in everything except industry. Industrial stocks shot up over 300%. It's safe to say that the market is more than ready for new cities, and big ones at that. Though, a larger city would obviously require a new population, and currently, we simply don't have the people to have a fully populated city at the scale our investors wish for. We could certainly convince people to move over though, but how exactly should we do that? A change in policy might help, but it'd be time consuming, and we don't know what the long term effects might be."

 YFC_focus_industrialize_or_die: "Industrialize or Die"
 YFC_focus_industrialize_or_die_desc: "It's obvious that liberalizing would be useless. There's a fascist to the south of us, and their doing perfectly fine in terms of population. Pen's suggestion was stupid, industry attracts people. We need more jobs, more buildings, more housing, impressive displays, and people will come flocking. If we have to burn a hole through our collective wallets, that's fine. Gotta spend money to make money, as they say!"

 YFC_focus_erasers_stockpiles: "Eraser's Stockpiles"
 YFC_focus_erasers_stockpiles_desc: "The large stash of money we found after taking the bunchivist capital is very much still there. Not in bunchivist land of course, we took it to our own capital, but besides that, the money has been untouched. While still technically property of Eraser, he's in jail, is he not? He most certainly wouldn't mind us... borrowing... some of that. He wouldn't even notice!"

 YFC_focus_develop_peoniele: "Develop Peoniele"
 YFC_focus_develop_peoniele_desc: "Peoniele, the supposed birthplace of Goiky's flowers, its natural beauty goes unseen anywhere else on the continent. Regardless of how nice it is, a good enough amount of people live there. A starting population is great for a city, however, we need to make sure to keep its natural beauty in tact, as to keep the current population from being unhappy. For now, turning dirt paths into roads and making a couple of apartments should be enough to house workers, then we can start on the big stuff."

 YFC_focus_develop_yoyleton: "Develop Yoyleton"
 YFC_focus_develop_yoyleton_desc: "Yoyleton is the most remote place in South Goiky, as of current. Having a small population, with lots of hard workers, that hick town has great potential. Strangely enough, it seems like some teardroppers live there as well. With the town being so far from the sea, it's a bit strange to see them, however, they mind their business, same as everyone else. Perhaps some water features should be in the works."

 YFC_focus_clamp_down_on_bunchivism: "Clamp Down on Bunchivism"
 YFC_focus_clamp_down_on_bunchivism_desc: "The obvious choice. Bunchivism has been a plague to our trading partners since the dawn of Goikean nation states, no longer shall a raider be able to steal our profits and plunder our bretheren in capital. We shall never, under any circumstance, allow a free Bunch to persist, and anyone who believes otherwise is a traitor to the free market. Let Podgornyv's rioters burn with the power of our might!"

 YFC_focus_trial_over_eraser: "Trial Over Eraser"
 YFC_focus_trial_over_eraser_desc: "Eraser was found on the frontlines, defending Northern Podgornyv when the war was still ongoing. We made quick work of his army, taking him prisoner shortly after. We intended to leave him there to rot, but apparently, someone managed to get into his cell, or at least close enough to be able to spread his messages to the remaining Bunchivist holdouts. Even now, there are rumors of instructions coming directly from Eraser, informing raider partizans on what to do. Clearly, we need to do something more extreme with him, however, his knowledge on our country, if these rumors are true, is quite... useful. Having someone like him in the cabinet, of course with some corrective punishment, may do us good. Whatever we do, it's important that he stays far away from any resistance efforts."

 YFC_focus_execute_pen: "Pen."
 YFC_focus_execute_pen_desc: "500 Million Vigintillion. A number so impossibly high, has somehow become owed to us. While the competition was still ongoing, Pen had promised to give his supporters a large sum of money. That amount, became debt, which he tried to pay off using a paper slip. Paper slips, made in the YFC of course, are not a 'real' currency, so the amount owed managed to transfer from his supporters, to us. We have no real interest in forcing him to pay that amount, but we do have an interest in making examples out of debt holders. He's a Bunchivist, was very close, too close, to Eraser, while vocally supporting efforts resisting our reign. The perfect example."

 YFC_focus_foster_new_society: "Foster a New Society"
 YFC_focus_foster_new_society_desc: "Bunchivists are still people. And with people, there is profit. Obviously, we've lost quite a bit of money from having to deal with the raiders, but if we have their entire population under our thumb, we could make it back in no time! Facilitating a new, reformed Bunch should be easy, and well worth the cost. Oh, the civillians should be allowed to live free and stuff too. That's totally important to us."

 YFC_focus_stimulate_bunch_business: "Stimulate Bunch Businesses"
 YFC_focus_stimulate_bunch_business_desc: "Podgornyv is currently quite barren. It seems to have at least been lived in when we got there, but there aren't many businesses. In all honesty, that should be expected. The (hopefully former) raider society would pillage anything they came accross. Those savages ruined any chance of Bunchivist business! In other words, we could certainly breathe life into this dying city. Maybe, tax breaks for business owners?"

 YFC_focus_establish_law_presence: "Establish Law Inforcement"
 YFC_focus_establish_law_presence_desc: "Listen, it's not really the police if they're privately owned. Besides, the former-Bunchivist territories definitely need someone there to establish order. We'll obviously be footing the police's salaries, but we'll probably make it back once they're unneeded. Right?"

 YFC_focus_blockys_offer: "Blocky's offer"
 YFC_focus_blockys_offer_desc: "Blocky is asking us if he can meet with Yellow Face to discuss his campaign. Or at least, we think? He wasn't the clearest in what he was asking for, besides a meeting to discuss things. Anyways, we can get it scheduled pretty soon."

 YFC_focus_bunchivist_new_deal: "The Bunchivist New Deal"
 YFC_focus_bunchivist_new_deal_desc: "Admittedly, attempting to convert the Bunchivist society into a less.. stupid one is quite challenging. We're a company, not a government. Well, I guess we are a government. Shit. Anyways, we've just started and already spent more money on this project than anticipated. We need to find a better way to generate money from the population, fast!"
