There is an active reorganization of production on a collective footing, local authorities are provided by democratic self-government bodies, and decisions in the highest echelons of power are made collectively. But this whole system is very fragile and suffers from childhood illnesses, since the front itself is very young. But the revolutionary fire on this soil has already been kindled, and many here have already realized that the main goal is to spread this fire to the entire continent."

 idea_DPZ_defenders_on_paper: "Defenders on paper"

The newly formed self-government called its main goal the protection of the environs of the Dream Island from marauders and bandits of the anarchist Goiky. In fact, the state from its very inception turned out to be afflicted with corruption and is actually controlled by the oligarchic clans, and the objects-fighters of the first created militia don't always understand what they are fighting for."
 
 idea_SEC_land_of_madness: "Land of madness"

Its participants settled mainly in the region of the Evil Forest, or rather, on its northeastern outskirts, where they firmly united in communities. Sacrifices, robberies, murders without trial have become normal phenomena in Redleaf and its environs."
 
 idea_GMD_coinys_domain: "Coiny's Domain"
 idea_GMD_coinys_domain_desc: "The Military District is Coiny's personal military dictatorship with all of the bad and none of the good.

 idea_GPR_old_alliance_desc: "The republic, declared in the west of the Greeny Plains, is based on a fairly strong deterrent from collapse in the form of an alliance of P/M/B. There is much more freedom for pluralism here, unlike other fragments of Goiky, and in general the central government is not so strong.

 idea_GPG_questionable_future: "Questionable future"
 idea_GPG_questionable_future_desc: "Goiky Provisional Government, located in the heart of the continent - Casland, is now in a difficult position. Despite the fact that it controls the most important settlements of the continent, these places have significantly decreased in population due to evacuations and banditry. In addition, the government has not taken a course in a certain direction, and endless disputes between factions don't fade away in the Council. So far, the crisis of the cabinet has not reached a large scale, but it's moving towards it very quickly, and if nothing is done, then it is quite possible that, one might say, the 'only legitimate' government of Goiky will collapse and the largest cities of the continent will again sink into anarchy."

After the onset of anarchy and the radicalization of society, the Großgoikysreich was formed here - a reactionary state of an open dictatorship, driven by ultramilitarism and nationalism. The segregation of 'wrong' objects according to many criteria is actively practiced - from the presence of upper limbs to size.

 idea_FFT_mother_anarchy_desc: "Not everyone accepted the methods of the Goikish Reich, or as they call it here, the 'snow fascists'. In the south of the Snowy Plateau, known as 'the forests', the anarchist communes declared the Free Territory from the Snowmount River to the outskirts of the Snowy Forest, where everyone who did not accept the fascist dictatorship began to flock. The settlements here exist autonomously and equally, and they solve national issues at the so-called 'settlement meeting'. So far, the main task of the anarchists is to protect against the attempts of the northern neighbor to return the forests 'to their native harbor', but tales of heroic objects that resist tyranny with all their might already go beyond the snowy plateau..."

 idea_BUN_criminal_state: "Criminal State"
 idea_BUN_criminal_state_desc: "Following the collapse of Old Goiky, a group of bandits and thieves started roaming around Southern Goiky, looting abandoned buildings and taking what they could get to make a life for themselves. As states formed, these small raiding communities grew more attatched to each other, especially as these states started to resent them for their way of life. These small raiding communities are now closer than even most states, despite being so remote and spread out. From Top Tap to Greenville, with Podgornyv at the helm, raiders and bandits alike have become united under Eraser's banner."

 idea_BUN_Ticking_Bomb: "On a Ticking Timed Bomb"

This land, though annoying to administrate, generates massive wealth, and has allowed trade routes to flourish, letting Goiky stay interconnected despite the chaos. The state, obviously, only exists to serve the company."

Numismatia is a bastion of capitalism and freedom, in a continent covered with tyranny, in both government and market. Objects from around the continent have fled here, and it is the job of Numismatian democracy to guarentee these people their right to life, liberty, and the persuit of happiness."
